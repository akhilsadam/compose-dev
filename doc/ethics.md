When engineers intend to create new technologies, they must keep in mind the ethical and professional responsibilities that are required for any engineering process. In the development of the current application, we applied two critical engineering ethics principles as well as the proper attribution of credit. The two engineering ethics principles we employed in the design of this project were beneficence and non-maleficence, and we also properly and explicitly gave credit to the authors of work utilized in our application.

When developing any engineering system, developers must keep in mind engineering ethics principles. In the current project, the two principles used were beneficence and nonmaleficence. Such principles are defined as follows:



* **Beneficence: **The principle of beneficence refers to the obligation that an engineer has to do good, meaning to act in the benefit of the user of the product or system developed.
* **Non-maleficence: **The principle of nonmaleficence refers to an engineer’s obligation to do no harm, meaning that no harm must originate from the product or system developed.

In our project, such principles were prioritized as an essential part of the design phase. The beneficence principle presents itself in the motivation for our application. The intent for developing this project was to provide an application that could positively affect the user by being able to analyze a song’s emotion. This could be extremely useful when trying to determine songs that are suitable for people that require music that evokes a specific emotion, such as happiness. Furthermore, music is also a stress-reliever and mindfulness promoter. For the second principle, non-maleficence, we considered the possible uses that this application could have, and no harm could originate from this system. The application can be used to analyze songs, so it does not cause harm to the user and it cannot be employed in such a way that could produce injury.

	

Furthermore, one professional responsibility present in our project is proper accreditation. In various engineering projects, the use of someone else’s work to develop new systems is not unusual. However, it is crucial that proper attribution of credit is given to the authors of software or data used not developed by the contributors of the current project. For the development of our project, we utilized a music programming language in python called ‘_musicpy’_ developed by the Github user _Rainbow-Dreamer_. The Github repository can be found by following the link in the Data section of the report. Also, since we utilized songs to analyze them, we credited the artist that created each song. Each of the songs pre-loaded into the application have the name of the artist in the title of the song. By providing proper accreditation, we ensure that the users of our project can navigate the data used correctly and determine its validity.
