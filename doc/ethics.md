Unfortunately, as with any other application, technology lends itself to misuse.\

One professional responsibility present in our project is proper accreditation. It is crucial that proper attribution of credit is given to the authors of software or data used not developed by the contributors of the current project. For the development of our project, we utilized a music programming language in python called [‘musicpy’](https://github.com/Rainbow-Dreamer/musicpy), developed by the Github user Rainbow-Dreamer. Also, since we utilized songs to analyze them, we credited the artist that created each song. Each of the songs pre-loaded into the application have the name of the artist in the title of the song.\

When developing any engineering system, developers must keep in mind engineering ethics principles. In the current project, the two principles used were beneficence and nonmaleficence. Such principles were prioritized as an essential part of the design phase. The beneficence principle presents itself in the motivation for our application. The intent for developing this project was to provide an application that could positively affect the user by being able to analyze a song’s emotion. For the second principle, non-maleficence, we considered the possible uses that this application could have, and no harm could originate from this system. The application can be used to analyze songs, so it does not cause harm to the user and it cannot be employed in such a way that could produce injury.\

So please treat the information provided by this application wisely, and do not use it to cause harm, intentionally or unintentionally.
