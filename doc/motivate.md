# Motivation  

Message interpretation has long been a difficulty. In stressful situations like those encountered onboard the ISS (International Space Station), or locations with poor connectivity, this problem becomes much more critical. In extreme weather conditions, such as when mountaineering, hyperventilation prevention and similar lifesaving techniques rely primarily on non-verbal communication, on the interpretation rather than the actual message. 
 
Most communication protocols, however, ignore non-verbal and metacommunicative messaging, and strictly focus on the actual message. We seek to alleviate this need by engineering communication that provides interpretive guidelines for messages which may otherwise induce opposite or inadequate responses by the receiving party. 

Considering phone calls are the most common method for long distance communication, we primarily restrict the metacommunicative aspect of communication to pitch, timbre, and rhythmic changes in speech. Some study has been conducted previously on these aspects: for example, persons onboard the ISS communicate with a single person on Earth, and this relatively constant supposedly induces stability.  
We instead consider this problem from the perspective of music theory, a well-studied framework for pitch and rhythm with respect to emotion, that has not yet been applied here. 

An initial step in the form of an application for chord-progression analysis will be taken in this paper. First, we will describe the basic functionality of this application.
